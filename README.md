These are few examples of my solutions to Codewars.com challenges.

You can view my Codewars profile at https://www.codewars.com/users/JCLes92 for a summary of my codewars endeavors.

As of today (July 26, 2016) I have completed 101 challenges on Codewars.com, and would strongly recommend it as a resource to those learning to code or learning a new language.
