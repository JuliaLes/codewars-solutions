This repository contains a few examples of my solutions to Codewars.com challenges.

You can view my Codewars profile at https://www.codewars.com/users/JCLes92, which provides a summary of my endeavors.

As of today (July 26, 2016) I have completed 101 challenges on Codewars.com, and would strongly recommend it as a resource to those learning to code or larning a new language.
